# Predicting Stock Market Time-Series Data: CNN-LSTM Neural Network Model vs Stacked-LSTM NN Model vs BiDirectional-LSTM NN Model

## Overview

This school project researches stock market time series data price prediction, with a focus on an article which uses a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict stock market prices in comparison to other machine learning models like Random Forest, LBL-LSTM, k-NN Regression, SVM, and more. The article highlights the challenges of highly volatile and complex nature of stock market pricing and proposes that their CNN-LSTM machine learning models produce superior predictions on a comparison of accuracy markers.  

Our task in this project is to replicate the referenced code in article and create an upgraded version of LSTM machine learning model that will increase the model's performance.  Given the vast amount of options available to us and reduced time to test and train deep learning models we have narrowed down our possible enhancements to a Stacked-LSTM model and a Bidirectional-LSTM model.
