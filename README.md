# Predicting Stock Market Time-Series Data: CNN-LSTM Neural Network Model vs Stacked-LSTM NN Model vs BiDirectional-LSTM NN Model

## Overview

This repository predicts stock prices using a combination of two AI models, CNN and LSTM. CNN helps identify patterns in the data, while LSTM focuses on the sequence of events over time. This combined approach is more effective than older methods because it handles the complexity of stock market data better. Let me know if you'd like to add more details!
